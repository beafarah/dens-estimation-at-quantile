# Resampling method for density estimation at a survival quantile
Implementation of a resampling procedure was inspired by Lin et al., 2015 that allows to estimate the density at a given quantile $f(F^{-1}(p))$, for a given probability $0 < p < 1$.
We require the densities at the quantiles to be strictly positive, and we denote as $\hat{F}$ the consistent estimator for $F$ obtained from the usual Kaplan-Meier estimation. Taking this estimator we obtain $\hat{F}^{-1}(p)$ the estimators of the inverse distribution at $p$. Then we propose the following estimation procedure:

1. Generate B realizations of the gaussian $T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$, denoted by $T_1,..., T_B$
2.  Calculate $\sqrt{n}\left( \hat{F}\left(\hat{F}^{-1}(p) + \dfrac{T_b}{\sqrt{n}}\right) - p \right), b = 1,..., B$ and denote them as $y_b$, then the least squares estimate of $f(F^{-1}(p))$ is $\hat{A} = (x'x)^{-1}x'Y$, where $x= (T_1,..., T_B)^T$ and $Y = (y_1,..., y_B)^T$

## Variance selection 
### Impact of the variance on the MSE
We advocate that the selection of the variance of the sampled Gaussians is crucial, as it can significantly affect the accuracy of the density estimation. 
In order to highlight this, we illustrate the estimation of the density at the median for an exponential distribution with rate $1.5$, and compute the MSE for a range of values of $\sigma$. We perform 100 repetitions of the code, assume censoring to be independent and to follow an exponential distribution with rate 0.48. We generate $B=10^5$ zero-mean Gaussians. 
The code to generate these simulations is available on `MSE/Densite_Point_Estim - Exponential.R`.

We notice that, especially for small sample sizes, the value of $\sigma$ plays an important role in the value of the MSE. Indeed, as sample size increases, the region where MSE is minimized becomes broader, which allows for greater flexibility when choosing the variance within a wider interval of values where the MSE is close to zero. For all sample sizes, we observe that the MSE has a pattern where it decreases until it reaches a plateau, where it remains low over a range of $\sigma$ values, before increasing again. Our goal in practical applications where survival and censoring distributions are unknown is to be able to automatically detect, from the observed times, such a plateau, and select a value of $\sigma$ that lays inside this interval, which grows broader as sample size increases.

### Grid-search algorithm for variance selection
In practice the true value of the density at the quantile is unknown, so we cannot directly compute the MSE to identify the plateau described earlier. We propose a grid-search algorithm to automatically identify this plateau, which will allow us to select an appropriate value for $\sigma$. This procedure is implemented in `src/code_source` and `src/simulations_and_results`.

We illustrate this algorithm for an exponential distribution with rate 1.5 with censoring that follows an exponential with rate 0.12 (approximately 10% of censoring). We are interested in estimating the density of the exponential at the median, for which the true value is 0.75. We then perform the estimation of the density at the quantile for a grid of $\sigma$  that ranges from 0.1 to 10, in steps of length 0.05. We observe that there exists an interval of values of $\sigma$ such that the estimation is small before it and decreases after it as well. We aim to choose a value of $\sigma$ that lays inside this interval, because this is the interval that corresponds to the values close to the true value (represented by the dotted red line). Our code allows us to detect such interval and then it chooses a value of $\sigma$ that lays inside it. The chosen value is represented in the vertical blue line in the corresponding figures. In this illustrative example, we obtain an estimation of the density at the median equal to 0.745831, for a corresponding value of $\sigma$ equal to 3.75.

The folder src has the corresponding codes for computing the estimation of the density for the Exponential and Cauchy distributions. The estimations using our proposed procedure are compared to the ones obtained using kernel density estimation (KDE) with bandwidth parameter approximated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Our implementation of LOOCV in the presence of censoring is available on `src/code_source.R`.
